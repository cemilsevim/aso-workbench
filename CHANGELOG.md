# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here, newest first. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

The in-app updater shows the section of the new version as its release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- A Windows package of the window: `scripts\package-windows.ps1 -Window` builds one folder with the window (self-contained .NET) and `aso.exe` with its Swift runtime, so it runs without .NET or Swift installed. CI uploads it for every pull request.
- Release markers and their effect outside the macOS app: the App Store release is recorded as a marker when `aso measure` or `aso ratings check` sees a new version (dated with Apple's release date), `aso markers list|add|remove` keeps notes on the same timeline, Δ `lastMarker` compares against the latest one, and `aso impact` shows the ranks before and after a marker, weighted by what each keyword is worth. The Windows and Linux window gains a Changes tab.
- Ratings, written reviews and competitors outside the macOS app: `aso ratings check|list` (rating count and average per storefront, change since the last check, when a new rating last arrived), `aso reviews check|list` (Apple's public feed; reviews not seen before are marked new, with storefront, rating, new-only and text filters) and `aso competitors` (apps in the latest results of the tracked keywords). `aso measure` reads ratings and new reviews in the measured storefronts first, as the macOS app does. The Windows and Linux window gains a ratings card on the Overview and Competitors and Reviews tabs.
- The keyword table and inspector outside the macOS app: `aso keywords show` (history, best rank, top ten, signals, difficulty), `keywords note`, `measure --keywords` and `keywords list --csv` (the macOS CSV). The Windows and Linux window gains filters, multi-select (measure, copy, remove), CSV export and an inspector with the rank chart, top results, note and measurement log.
- Apps and markets outside the macOS app: `aso app search`, `app add --markets --device`, `app genre`, `market add|list|remove`, `storefronts` and `genres`. The Windows and Linux window gains an Add App dialog (search by name, device, several markets), an Overview with the Apple Ads genre and the markets, and a Keywords view per market.
- Settings and connections outside the macOS app: `aso settings` (the app's preferences and defaults) and `aso connections` (store, inspect, test and remove the Apple Ads, App Store Connect, OpenRouter and RevenueCat keys; keys only from files or standard input). The Windows and Linux window has a Settings tab with General, Measurement and Connections, connection dots in the sidebar, and the start-up refresh of markets not measured recently (`aso measure --stale`).
- A window for Windows and Linux (`desktop/`, C# and Avalonia) on top of `aso`: tracked apps, keywords with rank, Δ, difficulty and brand verdicts, rank measurement with progress, search, autocomplete, difficulty components and the metadata check. See [docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md).
- `aso measure --json` reports progress as JSON Lines on stderr, and `aso difficulty --json` includes every component with its weight and explanation.
- `aso`, the engine on the command line: track apps and keywords, measure ranks, list them with Δ, difficulty and brand verdicts, and look up search results, autocomplete, difficulty and metadata limits. Text or `--json` output; its own SQLite data file. See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

### Changed
- The AI writer no longer uses em or en dashes as punctuation, and list lines in descriptions and What's New start with "•".
- Interface text uses commas, colons and periods instead of em dashes.

### Development
- Continuous integration on macOS builds the whole package, runs the tests and bundles the app for every pull request.
- `ASOCore` and `ASOProviders` no longer depend on Apple-only frameworks when built elsewhere: on Linux and Windows the package uses Apple's API-compatible swift-crypto instead of CryptoKit and leaves out the macOS app. The macOS build still has no dependencies.
- Windows: continuous integration builds and tests everything but the macOS app with Swift 6.2.4 and 6.4.1, and packages `aso.exe` with exactly the Swift runtime DLLs it needs (`scripts/package-windows.ps1`), so it runs without a Swift toolchain. The engine uses Windows' own SQLite, output is UTF-8 in any console, and dates show in the system's time zone even where Foundation reports GMT. API keys in credentials.json are encrypted with DPAPI for the Windows account; plain files from earlier builds are read and encrypted on the next save.
- Tests pin JWT signing, key fingerprints, screenshot checksums and the HTTP client's allow-list and error mapping.
- The impact weighting (keyword value, the visibility curve, gains and value tiers) moved from the app's Changes view into `ASOCore`, with tests. Nothing changes in the app.
- The ratings trend (latest count, change, last new rating) and the rule for skipping a repeated reading moved from the app into `ASOCore`, with tests. Nothing changes in the app.
- Rank history (Δ and before/after), keyword verdicts (brand, golden, lead) and idea gaps moved from the app's data model into `ASOCore`, with tests, so every platform computes them the same way. Nothing changes in the app.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-22

First public release.

### Track
- Rank tracking per country and device from public App Store search (top 200), with gaps shown as gaps.
- Rank history chart with release and change markers; Δ against the last release, the previous or first measurement, or 7 days ago.
- Automatic release detection and a timeline of releases, applied metadata changes and your own notes, with a value-weighted before/after report.
- Ratings per storefront over time and written reviews from Apple's public feed.

### Research
- Popularity in layers: Apple's monthly Search Term Rank lists, the optional Apple Ads website index, and a bundled model estimate for everything else.
- Difficulty (0–100) from the top ten public results, with every component shown.
- Golden keywords, relevance ("Fit") and brand detection, competitor keyword import, autocomplete ideas.
- Try your keywords in other countries, including AI-suggested local-language forms, and track the winners in one click.

### Write and publish
- AI metadata writer ranked by winnable keywords first, "Make better", write all locales, What's New for every language.
- Rule engine for title, subtitle and keyword field (no filler, no repeats, room used), per storefront.
- Publish to App Store Connect: create missing languages, copy screenshots, create the next version, re-read after writing.
- Legal footer (Terms of Use and Privacy Policy) added to every description automatically.

### Measure
- Your Apple Ads campaign results per keyword and country.
- MRR and subscriptions from RevenueCat.

### App
- New name: ASO Workbench (early private builds were called ASO Studio; their data folder and settings move over automatically on first launch).
- Update checker for new GitHub releases; automatic data backup before a new version first opens the data.
- Clear connection guide: what each key unlocks, where data goes, how to get it.
